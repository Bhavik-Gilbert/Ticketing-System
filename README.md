# Ticketing-System

## What Am I
This repo is the codebase for a mockup task ticketing system. What this means is that users are able to create groups for teams to be invited to, which can host multiple projects where team members can access the different tasks that have been shared onto the system. Any user can take on a task shared, but once taken, only they can mark that task as completed unless they drop the task, in which case another team member will be able to take on the task in there stead.

This system helps teams to determine what work is avaiable alongside who completed what jobs, thereby making traceback and understanding for managers and colleagues much easier since they can find who did what and contact them about any questions.
